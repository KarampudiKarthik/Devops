## mutlistage docker file

clone the gir directory to local
```
git clone -b vp-docker https://github.com/imranvisualpath/vprofile-repo.git
```
it will download project to local
```
cd vprofile-repo
```
```
cd Docker-app
```
we can see docker file there, by using ls command

in that docker file. there is a problem. we need to put the tar file manually(we need to download the it and make it tar file). but we can automate it.

```
mkdir multistage
```
```
cd multistage
```
create docker file
```
vim Dockerfile
```
paste
```
FROM openjdk:8 AS BUILD_IMAGE
RUN apt update && apt install maven -y
RUN git clone -b vp-docker https://github.com/imranvisualpath/vprofile-repo.git
RUN cd vprofile-repo && mvn install

FROM tomcat:8-jre11

RUN rm -rf /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/*
