## Terraform setup

open windows shell as admin
```
choco install terraform
```
now we need to access aws. for that we need to install aws cli
```
choco install awscli -y
```
now we need to configure aws
1. create IAM user in AWS and give administator access
2. here we get access and password keys
3. create a key pair `dove-key`
4. create security group
   
open git bash
```
aws configure
```
here paste the keys

create a directory and go to that path and write in a `my_instance.tf` file

```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
  #   access_key = ""
  #   secret_key = ""	
}

resource "aws_instance" "intro" {
  ami                    = "ami-03657b56516ab7912"
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  availability_zone      = "us-east-1"
  key_name               = "dove-key"
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["sg-0780815f55104be8a"]
  tags = {
    Name    = "Dove-Instance"
    Project = "Dove"
