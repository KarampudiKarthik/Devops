## Backend

terraform store locally. if we are working in team, everyone has different state of env. we need to sync everyone into one state
. we store this state file in s3 bucket.

1. create S3 bucket in aws manually `terra-state-dove`
2. create folder `terraform`

backend file:
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terra-state-dove"
    key    = "terraform/backend"
    region = "us-east-2"
  }
}
```
now apply, all commands

terraform state file will store in s3 bucket. if anyone in team make changes, the file will get updated.
